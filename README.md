# webproject
This web page was designed for gamers that are looking for teammates to play together with,
clicking on each of the game icon meant to lead them to specific game's chatting room,
where in there they can see others posting and therefore form teams.
front end was all developed using html,css,js.
and can use bottom from the header to alter through home/gathering hall/login site,etc...
//TODO: backends.
